# TrueSight

Hi, this is a project I'm building to explore how to tell if an image is real or AI-generated. It's still in progress, and I'm figuring out most things as I go.

I started this out of curiosity — I saw some DeepFakes and AI artworks online that made me wonder: how do people detect fakes? I’m a freshman and still learning, but I thought doing a small real project might help me understand things better.

## What I'm Trying to Do

- Load an image
- Run it through a model that says if it's fake or not
- Try Grad-CAM or other methods to see what the model focuses on
- Build a small demo in a notebook, maybe later on the web

---

## What I Have So Far

- The repo is set up 😅
- A demo notebook that loads an image and gives a fake result (just a placeholder)
- Haven’t trained a real model yet — that’s next!

---

## Stuff I Don't Know Yet (But Hope to Learn)

- How to prepare and label datasets
- How to train deep models like Xception
- How to not crash my computer 😬
- How to explain what the model “sees”

## Why This Repo Exists

Honestly, this is part of something bigger — I want to slowly build a few useful projects over time. If I can keep this going, maybe it'll help with future research ideas or study plans. But mostly, it’s for learning by doing.

If you're reading this and have any feedback, I'd love to hear it.
